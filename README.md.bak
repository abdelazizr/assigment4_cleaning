#This script is for the coursera Week 4 assignment.

#First Step: Load the necessary libraries
Here are just loading each individual files to its respective variable names
# Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Let's read the data
adding columns title to subject files
adding column title to measurements files
add title to label files
combine them by using the rbin function. The ouput file is a complete file with test and training dataset.

#Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
only keep the columns we want. Here we are using the grep function as well as regular expression to pick
the columns we are interested in

#Step3 :Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Add title to label files


#Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

#Step 5:From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Here the code just picks the necessary fields and write the output to a .txt file
